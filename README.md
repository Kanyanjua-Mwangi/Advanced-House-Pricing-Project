Housing Market Dynamics Analysis

Overview
This project explores housing market dynamics using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Regression. We aim to develop a predictive model for median housing prices based on various housing-related features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains diverse features related to housing characteristics, including crime rates, zoning regulations, and socio-economic indicators. Each observation represents a unique housing unit.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: We preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, scale the features, and prepare the data for analysis.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): We employ PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify significant components capturing variance.
Linear Regression: We fit a Linear Regression model to the transformed PCA data to predict median housing prices.

Results
The analysis provides insights into the factors driving housing prices, offering practical implications for real estate stakeholders. The predictive model developed using PCA and Linear Regression helps understand housing market dynamics and informs decision-making processes.
